Vanya Christopher - Developer Portfolio ðŸ’»

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository! ðŸŒŸ
This repository contains a collection of a few of my software projects, experiments, and learning journeys as a Computer Science student.

I'm a junior at university. My focus is software engineering, and I am currently studying Android mobile app development. I'm especially interested in
creating intuitive, user-centered applications, websites, and building tools that are both practical and enjoyable to use.

Projects:

**Library Simulator (In progress)
This is a fun interactive story type game where the user can borrow/return books and movies.
They can even create their own custom libraries with custom books.

**Counter Project
This is a simple, fun app that can run on Android. User clicks a button and watches counter go 
up. It has launch sound and reward sound/notification for every 10 taps. See more info in the 
README.md file inside the project folder.
