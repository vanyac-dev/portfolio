Vanya Christopher - Developer Portfolio ðŸ’»

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository! ðŸŒŸ
This repository contains a collection of a few of my software projects, experiments, and learning journeys as a Computer Science student.

I'm a junior at university. My focus is software engineering, and I am currently studying Android mobile app development. I'm especially interested in
creating intuitive, user-centered applications, websites, and building tools that are both practical and enjoyable to use.

                                        Projects:

**Library Simulator ðŸ“š (In progress):

This is a fun interactive story-style game where users can borrow and return books and movies.
They can even create their own custom libraries with custom books.

**Counter Project ðŸ”¢:

This is a simple, fun Android app where the user taps a button to increment a counter. The app plays a launch sound and reward sound/notification every 10 taps. 
*More info available in the README.md file inside the project folder.
